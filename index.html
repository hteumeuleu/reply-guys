						I would have shouted “No” and kicked his butt! It’s easy!
					</p>
					<p>
						Dress more like a scientist & men won’t be tempted
					</p>
					<p>
						Now you know that was a bad mentor/lab/dept. What a great learning experience for you
					</p>
					<p>
						Choose your battles. Tough it out, focus on the science and you’ll be fine
					</p>
					<p>
						Why didn’t you speak out at the time?
					</p>
					<p>
						You go girl! The future is female! Good luck with that

					</p>

						You seem upset. Perhaps you aren’t able to handle rational discourse
					</p>
					<p>
						If you get angry, they win
					</p>
					<p>
						The mouth on you! No wonder u got harassed
					</p>
					<p>
						Name calling is hardly productive, madam
					</p>
					<p>
						Piling on this guy isn’t helpful. I bet he learned his lesson and was probably misunderstood
					</p>
					<p>
						Such nasty vitriol! All I did was calmly point out that women are irrational & unfit to do science
