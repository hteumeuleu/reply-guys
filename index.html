							Dress more like a scientist & men won‚Äôt be tempted
						</p>
						<p>
							Now you know that was a bad mentor/lab/dept. What a great learning experience for you
						</p>
						<p>
							Choose your battles. Tough it out, focus on the science and you‚Äôll be fine
						</p>
						<p>
							Why didn‚Äôt you speak out at the time?

						<p>
							You go girl! The future is female! Good luck with that

						</p>
						<p>
							You seem upset. Perhaps you aren‚Äôt able to handle rational discourse
						</p>
						<p>
							If you get angry, they win

						<p>
							The mouth on you! No wonder u got harassed
						</p>
						<p>
							Name calling is hardly productive, madam
						</p>
						<p>
							Piling on this guy isn‚Äôt helpful. I bet he learned his lesson and was probably misunderstood

							Something similar happened to a man once, therefore you didn‚Äôt experience sexism.
						</p>
						<p>
							His intentions were good. It‚Äôs a compliment.
						</p>
						<p>
							He never assaulted women in front of me!
						</p>
						<p>
							I need to know the exact context or I‚Äôll assume you‚Äôve blown this out of proportion.
						</p>
						<p>
							He‚Äôs just an old-school gentleman from a different culture with a hands-on mentoring style.
						</p>
						<p>
							Sexism is just an old man problem. When they all retire everything will be better!
						</p>
						<p>
							If sexism was *that¬®common I would have noticed.
						</p>
						<p>
							And by the way, she‚Äôs no saint either.

						<p>
							Not all men do bad things! My gf says I'm amazing

						<p>
							In faculty meeting somebody made a sexist remark & I thought to myself "that is so messed up"
						</p>
						<p>
							Hey did you see we gave a woman an award? Yeah it feels pretty good to do charity
						</p>
						<p>
							Some workplaces have problems with sexism but my mentees and 1 are BFFs ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è #coolboss

						<p>
							If we start holding men responsible for their actions, where will it end?
						</p>
						<p>
							She's just claiming harassment to get ahead, and he is suffering for it
						</p>
						<p>
							We can't start protecting women until you can prove that nothing bad will ever happen to a man EVER
						</p>
						<p>
							I'm afraid to work with women now :(
						</p>
						<p>
							He is really going through a lot, the rules are changing, it's hard out there
						</p>
						<p>
							Censorship! Why can't I say whatever comes into my mind while everyone walks on eggshells around me
						</p>
						<p>
							If you keep this up, men will stop hitting on women at work and the human race will go extinct

							Would you answer my endless bad-faith questions, which I could easily google on my own, with a little less attitude please?
						</p>
						<p>
							If you don‚Äôt respond to me, you‚Äôre admitting I‚Äôm right. If you DO respond to me, this never ends
						</p>
						<p>
							Pics or it didn‚Äôt happen. Statistics or it didn‚Äôt happen. Your testimony is unreliable solely because you are female.
						</p>
						<p>
							Why won‚Äôt you repeat all the details of your painful harassment story on demand and post all the evidence?
						</p>
						<p>
							Is there even evidence that harrassment exists? I mean numbers, not some ANECDOTE
						</p>
						<p>
							The burden is on you to waste time disproving my wild unsupported claims. Then I'll deny l ever said it. Ready?

							Ah, I see you are interested in X, [person who has studied X for 20 years]! I have researched it all morning and it's more complex than you'd think. For instance did you know
						</p>
						<p>
							No, you didn't technically ask for advice, but a woman stating a fact is a cry for help

						<p>
							Your ideas were debunked years ago by a guy named‚Ä¶ I think it starts with an F? Look it up, dummy
						</p>
						<p>
							I notice you wear makeup. I thought you said you were a feminist. True feminism, you see [is wrong for 5 tweets]

						<p>
							There are many common misconceptions about what actually constitutes 'mansplaining'

						<p>
							He's essential to his field. He's a genius. I have never heard of YOU
						</p>
						<p>
							Any system that rewards me is by definition a meritocracy. If women want to get ahead they can buckle down and do way more work than me
						</p>
						<p>
							Great men can't be shackled by ethics
						</p>
						<p>
							Women love to rub their degrees in our faces ‚Äî so tacky. A well-tailored suit tells you all you need to know about my qualifications

							Dealing with sexism would distract from my important work. It doesn't affect me, and working on it won't impress other men
